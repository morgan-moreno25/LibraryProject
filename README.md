# Library Project

This project was inspired by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com)

## OVERVIEW
---
The goal of this project was to create an application that simulates a library where data is stored across sessions and a user can add / remove books from the library.

For the Book objects I decided to use factory functions. I made this decision because I felt this was the simplest way to create multiple instances of a Book object.

I used ES6 classes to create a View object and a Controller object. The View object was used to create, render, and add event listeners to elements inside the document. The Controller object was used to add books, remove books, and control what data was to be rendered by the View object. I decided to use ES6 classes here to practice using them in a project. I learned of the importance of using arrow functions to ensure that the `this` keyword was referring to the class object.

I used LocalStorage as a way to store user data across sessions.
