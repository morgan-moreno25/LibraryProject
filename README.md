# Library Project

This project was inspired by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com)

## OVERVIEW
---
The goal of this project was to create an application that simulates a library where data is stored across sessions and a user can add / remove books from the library.


For this project I decided to use a MVC design pattern approach.
    
- Model: Factory Function (Multiple instances of Book objects)
- View / Controller: ES6 Classes (Practice)

I used LocalStorage as a way to store user data across sessions.
